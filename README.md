We decided to do a data analysis project that analyzed NFL combine data from 2009-2019 and players personnel information (height, weight, age) to see if we could find the most important features for predicting a players draft position. In order to clean our data file, we created new columns for any feature that had an NA value and we used one hot encoding to convert categorical data into numeric data. We then ran an OLS linear regression to inspect the regression weights of our features and a Mean Decrease Impurity test to assess the overall importance of each feature. We used and analyzed these two test results to make a baseline recommendation to NFL general managers of what components they should consider when analyzing players. We believe that our model can be further improved by adding more features such as a player's college statistics, social media posts they are mentioned in, and NFL scouts rankings of these players to improve our draft predictions.
